# credit-risk-classification
The purpose of this project was to evaluate and create a logistic regression model to classify loans as healthy(0) or high-risk(1). The goal was to determine the models ability to accuratley predict loan statuses, which might help a financial institution mitigate credit risk and optomize lending strategies. 

Results
- Accuracy Score: 99%
- Precision Score:
  - Healthy Loans(0): 1.00
  - High-Risk Loans(1): 0.85
- Recall Score:
  - Healthy Loans(0): 0.99
  - High-Risk Loans(1): 0.89
- F1-Score:
  -  Healthy Loans(0): 1.00
  -  High-Risk Loans(1): 0.87

The logistic regression model demonstrates strong performance in predicting loan statuses. For healthy loans, the model achieved near-perfect results, with a precision, F1, and recall score of 1.00. This indicates that it consistently identifys healthy loans accurately. For high risk loans, the models performance is strong. However, the lower precision (0.85) indicates some false positives in predicting high-risk loans. Overall, the model is 99% accurate and reliable in distinguishing between healthy and high risk loans. 

Given the high overal accuracy, I would suggest this model for use by the company. It provides robust predictions for healthy loans and performs well for high risk loans. However, additional strategies can also be explored like testing alternative machine learning models to compare results, and collecting more data to strengthen the models predictions.
